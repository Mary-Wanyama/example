## About The Project
>This site is primarily built in html and custom css.>The main reason for creating this site is to bridge the communication 
gap between the landloard and the potensial clients. The site is a trusted platform for both the citizens and the
foreigners. It has listed the contact of the stakeholders help lines for assistance. The project contains realtime 
pictures to allow the clients to choose the houses that they please as well. The houses with the highest sales have
also been included to help them make an informed decision. Theopinion of the past customers is allowed for future
bettering of the choices.
